## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- SASS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

It was a quite good challenge to practice the CSS Grid. I tried to solve the challenge with flexbox-grid combination (the slution is on the branch in this repository). But then I force myself to try it only with CSS Grid...and i dooscovered grid-template-areas! :-) 

### Continued development

- Try to solve the challenge with flexbox and grid mixins - go deeper in SASS.
- I need to do more challenges for CSS Grid.
